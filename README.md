#Drawing App
------------

This drawing pad was created with vanilla javascript, and made use of the canvas feature to allow the user to draw in the browser window.

##Features

1. Consists of a simple auto-drawing feature where a line will be drawn on the screen and bounce off the edges of the screen. This continues until it is stopped by the user.

2. Allows the user to change the size and color of the drawing line.

3. Features a square and circular eraser.

4. Gives the user the ability to clear the screen, and download the current image on the screen.

5. Supports mobile devices, and includes multitouch drawing. The mutltitouch drawing fills in the space between two+ fingers, which allows for interesting shapes to be drawn on screen.
